i8n-sherlock-cli üïµÔ∏è
i8n-sherlock-cli is a powerful command-line interface designed to streamline the management of JSON-based translation files. It helps you find, audit, and add translation keys with confidence, saving development time and preventing common i18n mistakes.

This tool is framework-agnostic and works with any project that uses a directory of JSON files for internationalization, such as those using next-intl.

Features
üîé Find existing strings and their translation status across all locales.

‚ûï Intelligently Add new keys with interactive typo detection and automatic reuse of existing translations.

üïµÔ∏è Audit locales to get a deep, comprehensive list of all missing keys.

üîÑ Sync locales by automatically adding missing keys from your base language.

üßπ Clean up your files by removing orphaned keys from deleted features.

üìä Get Detailed Statistics on Key Coverage and Translation Coverage.

üì§ Export missing work for translators into developer-friendly JSON or professional XLIFF files.

‚öôÔ∏è Highly Configurable to fit your project's unique file structure.

Installation
It's recommended to install the tool as a local development dependency in your project.

Bash

npm install i8n-sherlock-cli --save-dev
You can then run the tool using npx i8n-sherlock.

Configuration
The tool is configured using a single .i8n-sherlockrc.json file in your project's root. To get started, run the init command.

Bash

npx i8n-sherlock init
This will generate a configuration file with the following options:

JSON

{
  "baseLocale": "en",
  "locales": ["es", "fr-ca"],
  "path": "locales/{locale}/**/{namespace}.json",
  "allowIdentical": ["en-ca"]
}
baseLocale: The language that serves as the source of truth (e.g., "en").

locales: An array of all other language codes you want to manage.

path: The glob pattern that describes your file structure.

{locale} is a placeholder for the language code.

{namespace} is a placeholder for the JSON filename (without the extension).

Use /**/ to enable recursive searching in subdirectories.

allowIdentical: An array of locales that are permitted to have strings identical to the baseLocale without being flagged as "untranslated" (e.g., "en-ca").

Commands
All commands are run via npx i8n-sherlock <command>.

init
Initializes the project by creating a default .i8n-sherlockrc.json configuration file in the current directory.

Bash

npx i8n-sherlock init
stats
Displays detailed statistics about your project's translation health, broken down into two tables: Key Coverage (structural completeness) and Translation Coverage (actual translation work).

Bash

npx i8n-sherlock stats
--json: Use this flag to output the stats in a machine-readable JSON format, perfect for CI/CD pipelines.

find <text>
Performs a deep, exact-match search for a string. It first searches the base locale. If not found, it then searches all other locales to find "orphaned" strings.

Bash

npx i8n-sherlock find "Your string to find"
<text>: The case-insensitive string to search for, enclosed in quotes.

audit <locale>
Performs a deep audit and reports a list of all key paths that exist in the base locale but are missing from a target locale.

Bash

npx i8n-sherlock audit es
<locale>: The single locale to audit against the base locale.

sync <locale...>
Automatically adds keys that are missing in target locales. It finds all keys present in the base locale and creates them in the specified locales, using the base language string as a placeholder.

Bash

# Sync a single locale
npx i8n-sherlock sync es

# Sync multiple locales
npx i8n-sherlock sync es fr-ca

# Sync all locales defined in the config
npx i8n-sherlock sync all
<locale...>: One or more space-separated locales, or the keyword all.

--dry-run: Shows what changes would be made without writing to any files.

--yes or -y: Skips the interactive confirmation prompt.

clean <locale...>
Cleans up translation files by finding and removing orphaned keys that no longer exist in the base locale.

Bash

# Clean a single locale
npx i8n-sherlock clean es

# See what would be cleaned from all locales
npx i8n-sherlock clean all --dry-run
<locale...>: One or more space-separated locales, or the keyword all.

--dry-run: Shows what keys would be deleted without writing to any files.

--yes or -y: Skips the interactive confirmation prompt.

export-missing <locale...>
Generates a file containing a to-do list of all keys that are either missing or untranslated. This is the primary tool for preparing work for translators.

Bash

# Export a JSON report for Spanish
npx i8n-sherlock export-missing es

# Export an XLIFF file for all translatable locales
npx i8n-sherlock export-missing all --xliff
<locale...>: One or more space-separated locales, or the keyword all.

--xliff: Generates professional .xliff files with clean source text instead of the default developer-focused JSON report. This automatically excludes allowIdentical locales.

--force or -f: Overwrites an existing export file if one exists.

add <namespace> <key> <text>
The primary command for adding new strings. It's an intelligent, multi-step process:

Checks for duplicate keys or strings in the target namespace.

Searches other namespaces to find and reuse existing translations.

Interactively prompts you to correct potential typos in nested key paths.

Adds the key and string to all locales.

Bash

# Add a top-level key
npx i8n-sherlock add common myNewKey "My new string"

# Add a nested key using dot notation
npx i8n-sherlock add common user.profile.tagline "My new tagline"
<namespace>: The file to add the key to (e.g., common).

<key>: The key to create. Use dot notation for nested objects.

<text>: The new string for the base locale, enclosed in quotes.
